This project aims to explore the relationships between patients’ diagnoses, treatments, and lifestyle factors using a mental health dataset. The analysis compared the effects of different medication and therapy combinations on treatment outcomes, revealing that some combinations achieved higher recovery rates than others. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as age, physical activity, and sleep quality were found to have strong correlations with symptom severity, mood, and stress levels.

A machine learning model was developed to predict treatment outcomes; however, despite feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection efforts, no significant improvement in accuracy was achieved, highlighting challenges related to the dataset structure or sample size. Finally, the alignment between AI-detected emotional states and patients’ mood scores and treatment results demonstrated the potential effectiveness of AI in mental health assessments. This study provides valuable insights by applying multiple analytical approaches to mental health data.
